# Residential Buildings Layout Generator
Spatial Layout is a problem encountered in many real world domains. Such domain is building floor plans in Architecture, which is usually done manually, where an architect aims typically to divide a specific area into different high level components, and try to find suitable placements for some sort of low level modules inside these high level components.
So the aim is to build a generator of all possible layouts of residential buildings using constraint programming.
